You can use the `visibility` property of the `ActionItem` to dynamically hide and show items. You can also use binding for the visibility.

Here is an example of showing different action items when the app is in "editing" mode:

<snippet id='action-bar-hiding-action-items-xml'/>
<snippet id='action-bar-hiding-action-items-js'/>
<snippet id='action-bar-hiding-action-items-ts'/>
